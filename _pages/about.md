KCS is a new up and coming business first established in December 2015.

Mainly focusing on kitchens with great success to begin with we soon branched out into all areas of building and carpentry work from floring and tiling to conservatories and extensions.

We have and work with a good mixture of fully qualified tradesmen who are polite, punctual and precise.

We also undertake large site projects such as shop fronts and restaurant fit outs.

KCS take a lot of pride in it's work and always makes sure the client is fully satisfied.
