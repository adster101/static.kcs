Complete kitchen installation for Sarah.

We were pleased to be chosen by David to install his new kitchen.

The kitchen itself was on a mezzanine level of David's house which threw up a few challenges.

Interesting points:

 - Interesting mezzanine layout
 - White cupboards
 - We completed all the electrics and plumbing
 - etc

In the end we were on site for a total of only four days and David was left with a brand new kitchen and he was totally stoked!
